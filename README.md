# Olympic Medals Prediction: Machine Learning Project

This repository contains an end-to-end beginner machine learning project, used to predict the number of medals a counry will win in the Olympic Games based on historical and current data.

# Project Overview

The project followas a typical machine learning project workflow:

1. Formulating a hypothesis
2. Finding and exploring the dataset
3. Reshaping the data for prediction (if necessary)
4. Cleaning the data for machine learning
5. Choosing an error metric
6. Splitting the data for training and testing
7. Training a machine learning model

The project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and machine learning model development.

# Repository Contents

- 'machine_learning.ipynb': The main Jupyter notebook containing the machine learning project code.
- 'teams.csv': This is the team-level data used in this project.

# Local Setup and Installation
To run this project locally, ensure that you have Python 3.8+ installed. You also need to install the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn

You can install the packages using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn

# Data
We'll be using data from the Olympics, which was originally on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).
